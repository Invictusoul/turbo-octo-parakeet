Emergent Crime Hyperdimensional Analysis Toolkit

influencial individuals unseen influences
This repository provides a modular Python pipeline to analyze publicly available crime datasets in conjunction with public individual travel data. It performs hyperdimensional tensor decomposition to identify latent patterns and correlations across individual, group, location, time, and crime type dimensions.

⚠️ This project is purely methodological and exploratory. It utilizes open data from UNODC, FBI Crime Explorer, and Wikidata for demonstration and research reproducibility purposes.
Features
✅ Real dataset integration (UNODC, FBI Crime Explorer, Wikidata)

✅ SPARQL-based automated extraction of individuals by group

✅ SQLite-based structured storage pipeline

✅ Travel history mapping (prototype)

✅ ±72-hour crime correlation analysis

✅ Tensor decomposition (5D hyperdimensional)

✅ Matplotlib and Plotly visualizations (heatmaps, group influence networks)

✅ Google Colab notebook for immediate GPU deployment
